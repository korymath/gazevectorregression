run_single_test provides a single experiment 

all calibrations are sweep, eyes, free

the column switches between sweep and task

RXX - XX patient number
Calib(C|P) - cups or pasta, when this changes, task changes, always three for each
assume new task mean adjustment
_B_ - ignore (both eye and movement)
NN - 01, 02, 03 in sequence trials -- 1 and 2 are before
    then a whole bunch of trials, then 3 is the after trials calibration
_combined_segments - eye data,
